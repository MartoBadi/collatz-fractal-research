Visualizations - Fractal Structure in Collatz
This directory contains generated visualizations that demonstrate the fractal structure and preferential pathways in the Collatz graph.

Visualization Files
ðŸŽ¯ embudo_network.png
Description: Connected network of identified funnels

Insights: Shows how funnels form a preferential highway

Pattern: Recurrent connections with fixed step relationships

ðŸ“Š modular_distribution.png
Description: Distribution of funnels by modular class (mod 16)

Finding: NON-uniform distribution with specific patterns

Predominant classes: 0, 4, 6, 8, 10

ðŸ”— embudo_chain.png
Description: Main chain of connected funnels

Key sequence: 2734 â†’ 4102 â†’ 6154 â†’ 9232 â†’ 13858 â†’ ...

Relationship: Approximate ratio of 1.5 between consecutive funnels

ðŸ“ˆ growth_ratios.png
Description: Growth ratios between consecutive funnels

Pattern: Alternation between ~1.184 and ~1.267

Implication: Scalable fractal behavior

ðŸŒ€ fractal_patterns.png
Description: Fractal patterns across different numerical scales

Evidence: Statistical self-similarity in the structure

Levels: Low, medium and high with the same structural pattern

ðŸ”„ modular_symmetry.png
Description: Algebraic symmetries in modular distribution

Finding: Specific repetitive patterns

Theoretical basis: Underlying algebraic properties

ðŸŽ¨ sequence_heatmap.png
Description: Heatmap of sequence trajectories

Visualization: Density of passage through different values

Confirmation: Funnels as high-density points

Interpretation of Visual Results
Non-Randomness: Visual patterns contradict chaotic behavior

Organized Structure: Clear evidence of hierarchical organization

Fractality: Patterns that repeat at different scales

Preferential Highways: Specific paths that concentrate trajectories

Usage for Analysis
Each visualization corresponds to a specific section of the paper and provides empirical evidence for the theoretical claims about fractal structure in Collatz.
